In command prompt.

git - opens help. 

1) Go to the folder that you want to use as the shared Git Repository.

2) Click on the directory and then key in cmd to open Command Prompt.
   I had chosen a folder called "Git Repo" to be the folder.

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>


3) To initialise it as the repository, key in "git init" at the directory

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git init


4) To upload the files, put the files into the repository folder and then key 
   "git add -A" in the command prompt.

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git add -A

use git reset to unstage all files


5) If you want to check the status of the files key in "git status". 
   Green means good.

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git status


6) To commit the repository. Key in "git commit -a -m *message*".
   "-a" is to commit all files.
   "-m" is to add the message. 

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git commit -a -m "First Commit of the Project"


7) To add to the remote repository(online), key in "git remote add origin *url*".

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git remote add origin https://github.com/Machiavelrous/FootballProject.git


8) To see the online repository for fetch and push.

e.g: C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git remote -v


9) To push all the files. Use "git push origin master".

C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git push origin master


10) Done! Check the online repository.


11) To upload individual files, use "git add *filename.extension*" 

C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git push Steps_for_GitHub.txt


12) Continue with the rest of the steps without -a. 
    Also, file name must not have spaces in between.


13) To make another addition, be sure to go to directory first 
    open command prompt and "git pull *url*" to git pull.

C:\Users\...\Git Repo>git pull https://github.com/Machiavelrous/FootballProject.git


14) Once done git pull, follow steps from the first to upload again.

15) PLEASE DONT DELETE ANYTHING. 
I had alot of trouble when I deleted things in the repository.
Just create new folder and then commit all.
